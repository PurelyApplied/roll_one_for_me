After producing a god, try writing a quick description like it was a writing prompt. The categories are interpretative; a god symbolized by a torture device may be an S&M enthusiast or may have been tortured, leading to a whip or a cross. A god hated and loved because of nature might be responsible for wild chaos (owlbears, bulletes) and responsible for conventional animals (deer, rabbits).
